HW01
===
This is the hw01 sample. Please follow the steps below.

# Build the Sample Program
1. Fork this repo to your own github account.
2. clone the repo that you just forked.
3. Under the hw01 dir, use:
	* `make` to build.
	* `make clean` to clean the ouput files.
4. After make, you can run the program by `./main.elf` under the hw01 dir.

# Build Your Own Program
1. Edit main.c file. (Practice to use vim)
2. Make and run like the steps above.

**Notice that if you are going to add another source file or header files, you will have to modify the content of makefile.**

# HW01 Requirements
1. We are going to practice some C skills about function pointers and arrays of function pointers, please modify main.c with arrays of function pointers to simplify the code.
2. You have to push your code to your github. (Using .gitignore to exclude the outpufiles like object files or executable files)
